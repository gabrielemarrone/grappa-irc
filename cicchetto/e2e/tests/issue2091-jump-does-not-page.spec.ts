// issue 2091 — one arrow tap, counted in a real browser.
//
// 🔴 READ THIS BEFORE TRUSTING THIS SPEC AS EVIDENCE. It is GREEN with the cure
// and MEASURED GREEN WITHOUT IT. It does not discriminate the fix, and nobody
// should cite it as proof the fix works — the discriminating evidence is the
// frame-replay bench in `src/__tests__/ScrollbackPane.test.tsx`, which counts
// the pane's CALLS to the paging verbs and goes red without the cure.
//
// What this spec IS, then. The issue's acceptance asks for HTTP requests per
// tap, counted in a real browser, before and after. That number is this file's
// output and the answer is ZERO ON BOTH SIDES, on a 3000-row corpus with both
// pagers still armed. The defect is real — the asymmetry is read in the code
// and the bench counts up to 5 pager calls for one tap — but those calls do not
// become requests here: a smooth scroll over tens of thousands of pixels moves
// far enough per frame that no `scroll` event lands inside a 200px band, and
// the verbs' in-flight guard plus exhausted latch absorb what is left. The
// reported "hundreds of requests" is not reproduced in this substrate. That is
// a result, not a gap in the spec, and it is why the number lives here in a
// file that says so rather than in a commit message that implies otherwise.
//
// What it still guards, and can still go red on:
//   * the acceptance property itself — a tap must not fetch. It holds today for
//     reasons partly outside the cure, and a future change that makes the jump
//     anchor lazy, or widens a band, breaks it here first.
//   * the cure's most dangerous failure mode — suppressing the THRESHOLDS
//     rather than the CALLER. The positive control below scrolls the same
//     region with a real wheel and requires paging to happen. A gate written
//     against `distance` instead of against who scrolled turns that red.
//
// ── two fixture findings, both measured, both load-bearing ──────────────────
// (1) It was first written against the shared spec-subject's seeded autojoin
// channel (200 rows, `specSubject.ts:SEED_COUNT`) and that was VACUOUS for a
// second reason: with a 50-row REST page the scroll-to-top that sets the scene
// drains the corpus, both exhausted latches set, and from then on no pager can
// fire for ANY caller. Hence `SEED_ROWS` far above what one gesture can drain —
// the pagers must still be ARMED at the tap, or the zero has two explanations.
// (2) The positive control does NOT wheel until `scrollTop <= 200`. That
// condition is UNREACHABLE while the backfill pager is armed, which is exactly
// the state the control needs: every page it pulls is PREPENDED and
// `applyPrependPreserve` restores the reader's row by the height delta, pushing
// scrollTop back down by a page. Measured: the pane sat around 1048px through
// 80 notches of −600. What proves the wheel landed is that the BUFFER GREW.
//
// Chromium only: the gesture is layout-driven and the assertion is about the
// scroll engine, so this rides the same one-engine precedent as the other
// scroll-geometry specs (#168, #243, #360).
