# Cic-only deploy on the bastille jail — vite bundle rebuild + live
# hash broadcast, no BEAM restart.
#
# Run inside the jail as ROOT (jail_cic_build.sh drops to grappa via
# su -l; the curl runs as root against loopback):
#   sudo bastille cmd grappa-new /home/grappa/grappa/infra/freebsd/jail_deploy_cic.sh
#
# What it does (mirrors scripts/deploy-cic.sh for Docker):
#   1. git pull --ff-only (no separate jail_git_pull.sh step needed)
#   2. npm ci + vite build into runtime/cicchetto-dist/ (jail_cic_build.sh)
#   3. POST /admin/cic-bundle-changed so the live BEAM re-reads the new
#      index.html and broadcasts the bundle hash on every user-topic;
#      cic clients compare it against the hash baked into their loaded
#      page and surface the refresh banner on mismatch.
#
# What it does NOT do: touch the BEAM. No mix compile, no mix release,
# no service restart. Use for cic-only changes; server-side changes go
# through deploy.sh, which auto-classifies hot vs cold.
#
# Exit codes: 0 ok, non-zero on any failure (set -e).

# --recurse-submodules=on-demand completes the pull: without it a gitlink bump
# leaves this checkout dirty forever, and the NEXT server deploy compiles from
# a dirty tree and reports X.Y.Z-<sha>. A cic-only deploy runs no compile, so
# it does not pay the price itself — it hands it to whoever deploys next, which
# is exactly why the flag belongs on every door and not only the compiling one.
# Why + why not the bare flag: infra/lib/deploy_common.sh, above the
# substrate_pull call (#1851).
