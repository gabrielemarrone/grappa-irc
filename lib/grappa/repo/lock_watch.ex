  @moduledoc """
  Holder-vs-waiter observer for SQLite's single write lock (#1420).

  ## Why a new signal, and not another handler on the old ones

  Every DB signal grappa already emits is **completion-driven**, so all of
  them measure the VICTIM by construction:

    * `[:grappa, :repo, :query]` fires when a query FINISHES. A process that
      opens `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` and then sits still emits nothing at all while
      it sits; the only rows that reach the log are the 30-second `begin`s
      and `SELECT`s of everybody stuck BEHIND it.
    * `Grappa.Repo.BusyRetry`'s `:on_contention` hook fires inside a
      `rescue` — it counts, by definition, whoever caught the exception.
    * The #1429 CI census greps container logs after the fact: it sees the
      silence, never who caused it.

  The #1420 census hit that wall six times: `db30=4`, `dropped=2`,
  `saturated=2`, every gap exactly 30.1 s (the `busy_timeout: 30_000` of the
  WAITERS), and the issue's own "Not established" section names the missing
  datum — *"why the holder itself pauses [...] separating the two needs a
  running stack."*

  This module produces that running stack.

  ## The state machine

  `Grappa.Repo.immediate_transaction/1` is the ONLY producer of
  `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` in the tree, so there is exactly one seam to instrument.

  The split is free because of an ordering READ IN THE DEPENDENCIES, not
  assumed: `DBConnection.transaction/3` evaluates `begin/3` and only enters
  `run_transaction/5` on `{:ok, _}` (`db_connection.ex:1103-1107`), and
  `Exqlite.Connection.handle_begin/2` emits `"BEGIN IMMEDIATE TRANSACTION"`
  for `mode: :immediate` on an idle connection (`connection.ex:307`). So by
  the time the transaction fun runs, SQLite has already granted `RESERVED`:

      waiting()   -->  inside the `begin`, lock NOT yet held  ==> WAITER
      acquired()  -->  first statement of the fun, RESERVED held  ==> HOLDER
      released()  -->  transaction over

  The same reading gives the failure case for free: when `begin` raises
  (busy past `busy_timeout`) the fun never runs, so `acquired/0` never
  fires and a writer that timed out is never mislabelled a holder — the
  `after` simply drops its waiter row.

  It also gives the nesting case: on a connection already in a transaction,
  `handle_begin/2` emits `SAVEPOINT` instead (`connection.ex:310-315`),
  which is why the depth counter below exists — an inner release must not
  erase an outer holder.

  A waiter is a waiter whether it is blocked on SQLite's `busy_timeout` or
  queued on a DBConnection checkout — the two candidate topologies #1420
  names. Its sampled stack says which, so the instrument does not have to
  guess between them.

  ## What it reports, and when

  🔴 **One phenomenon, one prefix, one report (issue 1960).** A tick emits at
  most one kind of line, `db lock stall:`, and an `attribution=` field says how
  far the instrument could go towards naming the holder — `named`, `none` or
  `cohort`, in that order of claim strength (see `t:attribution/0`). Before
  that fold there were four literals (`db lock stall`, `… UNATTRIBUTED`,
  `… NIF CENSUS`, `… RESOLVED`) which an operator had to correlate by
  timestamp, and the arm was chosen by attributability, so consecutive ticks
  could describe one episode under two different words.

  ### The gate that made a named holder silent (issue 1960)

  🔴 A holder past `stall_threshold_ms` used to be reported only **with at
  least one waiter queued behind it**, on the reasoning that a
  slow-but-uncontended transaction is not a stall. **Measured in prod on
  2026-09-06 (jail `grappa-new`, 1.5.0), that gate is not a contention test at
  all.** The watch table has ONE producer, so the only writers it can see are
  the rare tail of this system's write load; every autocommit writer queued
  behind that holder is invisible to it. Nine stall episodes that day produced
  **two** announcements while holding, and five closed carrying
  `NEVER announced while it held` — each of them with the holder's pid and
  write path already in hand (`Vhosts.record_client_source/2`,
  `Session.Server.init/1`), printed only at release, i.e. exactly when the
  operator no longer needs it.

  The closing bracket had already settled the question in the other direction:
  since #1888 it fires on `announced or past_threshold?`, with no waiter
  conjunct. **The opening line requiring a queue was the asymmetry**, and one
  threshold policy over both edges is what removes it. What replaces the gate
  is not silence but honesty: the line always states the three seam numbers —
  holders registered, waiters registered, processes parked in the NIF — so a
  reader sees the contention evidence (or its absence) instead of inferring it
  from whether a line exists.

  ### The `:none` verdict (#1687)

  A queue past the threshold that named nobody is reported too. This verdict
  exists because the first one is blind by construction:
  `observe/1` has a single producer, so ONLY a writer that went through
  `Grappa.Repo.immediate_transaction/1` can ever be tagged `:holding`. Every
  autocommit single-statement write — `Grappa.Scrollback.persist_row/1`
  (`lib/grappa/scrollback.ex:227`) and its ~120 peers — takes the same file
  lock and owns no row here at all.

  This code used to answer that case with silence, on the reasoning that
  *"waiters with no holder are the pool's business, not the write lock's."*
  🔴 **Measured in prod on 2026-08-22 (grappa 1.3.1, `erlang.log.5`), that
  reasoning was half right and the conclusion was wrong.** Half right: the
  pool IS a real component — victims' `elapsed` decomposes as ~31 s of
  DBConnection checkout plus ~31 s of `busy_timeout`, which is the whole of
  the "62 s" that opened #1687. Wrong: through a ~170 s episode, with this
  observer ARMED at `stall_threshold_ms: 2_000` and 23 `busy_locked`
  terminals in the log, it emitted **zero** lines. A long unattributed stall
  was indistinguishable from a healthy system, so the one thing the operator
  learned from the instrument was nothing.

  🔴 **The line states what was OBSERVED and stops there.** It does NOT say
  the write lock is held by an unregistered writer — that is an inference,
  and the same prod episode shows pool queueing is an equally live cause.
  What it can vouch for is exactly: N registered writers have been queued
  past the threshold, and this many holders are registered (usually none).
  The two candidate causes are separated by the WAITERS' OWN STACKS, which
  it samples and carries — a waiter parked in `Exqlite.Sqlite3NIF` is
  blocked on the lock, one inside `DBConnection.Holder` is queued for a
  connection. Asserting a cause the frame never measured is the exact defect
  `terminal_message/3` in `Grappa.Repo.BusyRetry` was twice rewritten to
  stop committing (#1420, #1421); this verdict does not re-commit it here, and
  since issue 1960 neither does the shared line template — `subject_clause/3`
  is where the arm's honest verb lives, and only `:named` may say "held".

  ### One report per episode, on every verdict

  The row's `reported?` flag arms on the first report and disarms on release
  — otherwise a 30 s stall prints 30 times. Release emits a second,
  `:resolved` event carrying the TOTAL hold, so a NAMED episode has both an
  opening and a closing bracket.

  ### The bracket that speaks when the opening line never did (#1888)

  🔴 That closing bracket used to require `reported?: true`, which made it
  useless in the one case it is now for. **Measured in prod on 2026-09-01
  (grappa 1.4.1, jail `grappa-new`): a 31 s freeze — no request served, on any
  network — with this observer ARMED (`enabled: true` in `config/config.exs`,
  overridden nowhere) and not one line of its own between 12:06:57.328 and
  12:07:28.554.** Whatever kept the detection pass from speaking, the episode
  then closed in TOTAL silence too: no log line, no telemetry, no ring row.
  An instrument whose silence means both *"nothing happened"* and *"something
  happened and I could not say so"* has stopped reporting.

  So a hold past `stall_threshold_ms` now brackets whether or not it was ever
  announced, and the line SAYS which — an announced episode has an opening
  line above it carrying the holder's sampled stack, an unannounced one is the
  only record that episode left, and an operator needs to know which they are
  holding. The bracket is also where the ambiguity is cheapest to remove: by
  then the lock is RELEASED, so nothing on this path can be blocked by the
  stall it describes, which is exactly the trap the detection path lives in
  (#1715).

  What it carries is a `t:caller/0` and NOT a `t:sample/0` — see that type for
  why the two must not be folded together.

  Both seam verdicts share that one flag, and `:none` arms it on WAITER rows
  rather than a holder's. So `acquired/0` CLEARS it on promotion: a pid
  reported once while queued would otherwise carry an armed flag into its own
  hold and never be reportable as the holder it went on to become. A `:none`
  episode gets no closing bracket — there was no hold to total, and inventing
  one is the claim this verdict exists to avoid.

  ### The `:cohort` verdict (#1901)

  🔴 **Both verdicts above read the watch TABLE, and the table has one
  producer, so between them they observe the RARE tail of this write load.**
  Measured on the live node (`Grappa.Operator.db_latency_text!/0`, cumulative
  since boot): `messages insert` — `Grappa.Scrollback.persist_row/1`, an
  autocommit single statement — is **324 679** writes, while every source the
  seam does cover (auth, settings, themes, push, reap) is in the thousands.
  The dominant writer of this system has never owned a row here.

  So the third verdict does not read the table at all. Each tick walks
  `Process.list/0` and keeps the processes whose `current_function` is inside
  `Exqlite.Sqlite3NIF`, timing them from the first tick that saw them there.
  That reaches any writer, registered or not, because the property it reads is
  physical: `execute/2` and `step/2` are declared
  `ERL_NIF_DIRTY_JOB_IO_BOUND` (`deps/exqlite/c_src/sqlite3_nif.c:2066,2077`)
  and exqlite's own busy handler SLEEPS INSIDE the NIF rather than returning
  to Elixir to retry (`:332`), so a writer blocked on the file lock stays
  visible in `current_function` for the whole `busy_timeout`.

  🔴 **What it cannot do, and the line says so rather than guessing.** The
  same physics that makes the cohort visible makes it INDIVISIBLE: the writer
  holding the lock and the writers blocked behind it are all inside
  `Exqlite.Sqlite3NIF`, all reading `status: :running`, and nothing
  BEAM-visible separates them. So it reports the COHORT — every parked
  process, its elapsed, its `current_function` and the longest one's stack —
  plus how many of them the seam already knows as holders and as waiters.
  Naming the holder outright is what registering the autocommit writes (#1901
  axis 2, deliberately deferred) would buy, and asserting it from here is the
  class of claim `terminal_message/3` in `Grappa.Repo.BusyRetry` was twice
  rewritten to stop making.

  🔴 **The roster is VERIFIED at sample time (issue 1960).** The sweep that
  decides who is inside the NIF and the sample that prints them are two
  instants, and in prod the gap between them was wide enough to matter:
  measured on 2026-09-06, 8 of 11 census lines printed a headline about
  `Exqlite.Sqlite3NIF` over a roster whose own frames said
  `:gen_statem.loop_hibernate/3` (at 32 s) and
  `DBConnection.Holder.checkout_call/5` (at 2.1 s) — processes that had left.
  `nif_sample/2` now decides from the SAME read it builds the sample from, and
  a cohort that has entirely left produces NO line. That is why the noise cure
  is not a bigger threshold: the arm is silent because there is nothing true
  left to say, which is a different fact from being under a threshold.

  Two further limits, stated so a later reader does not have to rediscover
  them:

    * a transaction parked BETWEEN statements is not inside a NIF, so this
      verdict cannot see it. That case is `:named`'s, and it is covered
      exactly when the writer went through the seam;
    * `elapsed` is measured from the first TICK that saw the process there,
      never from its real entry into the NIF, so it is a LOWER bound
      understated by up to one `tick_ms`. A census that wanted the true
      instant would have to instrument the write path, which is the cost this
      verdict exists to avoid.

  Readers park in the same NIF, so a slow `SELECT` is in the cohort too. That
  is deliberate: the arm reports what it observed, and a reader holding a long
  read transaction is a real participant in the contention.

  ## Deriving the holder's identity instead of storing it

  No caller label is stored, and `immediate_transaction/1` grows no label
  argument. When the watchdog fires, the holder is still INSIDE the
  transaction, so its `:current_stacktrace` already contains the
  `immediate_transaction` frame and every caller frame above it. The
  identity is derived at report time and costs the hot path nothing.

  ## Doors

  `Logger.warning` (the door that reaches CI container logs, which is where
  #1420's evidence lives) plus a `:telemetry` event that `Grappa.DbLatency`
  folds into a bounded ring — so `GET /admin/db_latency` and
  `bin/grappa db-latency` both inherit the data with no new noun.

  The warning carries the holder's scheduler `status` next to its
  `current_function`, because the two are one answer and only together do
  they name a cause. Measured on #1420's own stalls: a holder genuinely
  blocked inside `Exqlite.Sqlite3NIF.execute/2` on a contended
  `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` reads `:running` (so the write is slow), one that is
  merely queued and not being scheduled reads `:runnable` (so nothing about
  SQLite is slow), and a parked one reads `:waiting`. `sample/2` has always
  collected the byte; for four days the only door that reaches an artefact
  threw it away, and the two diagnoses stayed indistinguishable.
  `message_queue_len` is deliberately NOT in the line — it rides the
  telemetry door, which carries the whole sample, and the log line stays the
  two fields that answer the question.

  ## Cost and off-switch

  On the write path: one `:persistent_term` read, one `:ets.whereis/1`, and
  three ETS row operations per write transaction — against a WAL write
  transaction costing milliseconds. `Process.info/2` (which briefly
  suspends its target) runs ONLY once a stall has already been detected,
  on a process that is by definition already stopped.

  🔴 #1901's census breaks that last sentence and it is the one cost in this
  module that is paid when nothing is wrong: one `Process.list/0` plus one
  `Process.info(pid, :current_function)` per process, per tick, unconditionally.
  Measured on this repo's dev image, warm, 20 passes per point:

      500 procs   1 057us/pass      2 000 procs   1 550us/pass
      1 000 procs 1 036us/pass      4 000 procs   3 042us/pass
                                    8 000 procs   5 237us/pass

  i.e. ~0.7-2us per process, so at `tick_ms: 1_000` a 2 000-process node
  spends **0.16 % of one scheduler** on it. Nothing about that scales with
  write VOLUME, which is the property that makes it cheaper than the
  alternative it replaces: axis 2 of #1901 would put three ETS operations on
  every one of those 324 679 inserts. Sampling only the crossed processes
  keeps the expensive half — `sample/2` and its twelve formatted frames —
  behind the threshold, exactly as the other two arms do.

  #1888 adds ONE more `:persistent_term` read per write-transaction RELEASE
  (the threshold the bracket compares against). It is a read and not a write
  on purpose: a `persistent_term` WRITE is the thing that blocks on a
  thread-progress barrier (#1715), and the only write is the one `init/1`
  pays at boot. Everything else the bracket does — the caller's
  `$initial_call`, its own stack — runs only once the hold has already crossed
  the threshold, and reads the releasing process's OWN state, so it neither
  signals nor suspends anybody.

  Off by default; `config :grappa, :lock_watch, enabled: true` arms it.
  `config/test.exs` leaves it OFF — its own tests arm it explicitly.

  # `busy_timeout` inside a dirty-IO NIF, which holds that barrier for the

  # the lock wait — and THIS module's first line is its own stall report,

  # `debug` writes the same key with the same value `warning` would while
  # staying below the bar itself.
  #
  # 🔴 What this does NOT cover, so a later stall here is not read as a
  # regression of a cure that never claimed the ground. It is ONE of the
  # three mechanisms measured, and 6 of the 9 measured victims:
  #
  #   * `logger_config:set/3` — a CONFIG write, with no module key to prime;
  #   * `code:ensure_loaded/1` — module LOADING, a different serialisation
  #     point entirely;
  #   * the first log line of EVERY other module — measured on a booted dev
  #     node, 7 modules hold a cache key against 597 loaded — and in
  #     particular a CRASH REPORT, which is by definition the first line
  #     from whichever module just died;
  #   * the coupling itself, which is untouched.
  #
  # 🔴 And priming every module is not a bigger cure, it is a bigger bug:
  # `logger_config:set/3` on a PRIMARY level change does one
  # `persistent_term:put` per CACHED module (the flush loop), so
  # `Logger.configure(level: …)` would go from today's 7 waits to one per

  ## ----- Detection -----------------------------------------------------

  # 🔴 ONE report, three verdicts, and the fork is the SAME one the three arms
  # used to make between them — only now it chooses a field instead of a
  # prefix (issue 1960).
  #
  # The ladder is claim strength: a holder the seam named, else writers the
  # seam knows are queued, else the physical NIF population. See
  # `t:attribution/0` for why a registered waiter outranks a NIF resident.
  #
  # 🔴 Each rung forks on ATTRIBUTABLE, not on "did we print something", and
  # that split is load-bearing exactly as it was before the fold. Choosing the
  # rung by the REPORTABLE set instead would make an already-announced episode
  # fall through to the next rung on the very next tick and describe a holder
  # that is past the threshold as an unattributable queue — the instrument
  # lying in the act of being more talkative. Nameable-at-all and
  # not-yet-named-this-episode are two different questions, and only the first
  # one chooses the rung.
  #
  # 🔴 Known limit, deliberate: while a named episode is armed the cohort gets
  # no line of its own, so victims that pile into the NIF AFTER the announcing
  # tick are not enumerated until the closing bracket. That is the price of one
  # report per episode, and the alternative — a second line about an episode
  # already announced — is the correlate-by-timestamp reading this issue exists

  #
