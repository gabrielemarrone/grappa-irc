  @moduledoc """
  The gate behind the #1393d ruling: `Grappa.Protocol.version/0` bumps on
  EVERY wire-shape change, additive included.

  ## Why this is a separate task

  The obvious home for this rule is `mix grappa.gen_wire_types --check`, and
  it cannot host it. Measured on 2026-08-21, not assumed:

    * `--check` compares the REGENERATED artefact against the committed one,
      byte for byte (`verify_committed/2`). It touches no git and no network.
    * Add a field to a Wire typespec WITHOUT bumping the version, regenerate,
      and `--check` answers `in sync.` on both artefacts — green in exactly
      the case the rule exists to catch. It is not missing a condition; it is
      missing a BEFORE.

  Same shape as the reason `scripts/union-rebase.sh` is a VERB and not a
  check inside `design-notes-gate.sh`: a detector needs a before and an
  after, and a gate that only sees "now" has neither.

  ## The BEFORE, and why it is un-greenable

  `priv/wire/shape.pin` holds two facts TOGETHER: the digest of the
  generated wire shape, and the `Grappa.Protocol.version/0` it was taken at.
  Pairing them is the whole mechanism — `--update` REFUSES to rewrite the
  digest while the version stands still, so the only way to green a shape
  change is to bump the number, which is the rule.

  ⚠️ **Its own directory, and that is load-bearing, not tidiness.** `priv/`
  is NOT bind-mounted from a worktree — only `priv/repo` is, because `priv/`
  itself carries the SHARED `priv/plts` cache (`scripts/_lib.sh`). A pin
  written straight into `priv/` lands in the MAIN checkout, and a worktree
  run then reads a pin that belongs to no branch. Measured while building
  this: the first `--update` created the file in the main repo and the test
  suite went green against it. `priv/wire/` has its own override in
  `_lib.sh`, alongside the drift-pin inputs there for the same reason.

  ## The third component, and why a list could not be it (#2037)

  🔴 **Measured in this session, on this branch, not inherited:** a brand
  new field added to `GrappaWeb.MessagesJSON.count/1` — spec and body
  together — left `mix grappa.wire_pin --check` answering
  `wire shape and protocol 16 agree.` at rc 0, and
  `mix grappa.gen_wire_types --check` answering `in sync.` on the same
  tree, with the field appearing **0 times** in either generated artefact
  (positive control: 223 / 190 hits for a token that is in them; negative
  control 0). #2037 hit the same hole for real and the gate failed only on
  the VERSION field, printing a byte-identical digest across a two-field
  wire ADDITION.

  This is a RECURRENCE. #1679 met the class — `/boot` invisible to the
  tripwire — and cured it by adding one module to `gen_wire_types`'s
  hand-kept `@extra_modules` and writing a comment telling the next author
  to remember. The note did not hold, and it could not: the list is
  **fail-OPEN**, so forgetting it costs nothing and says nothing.

  Widening that list is not the cure either, measured: of the twelve
  `GrappaWeb.*JSON` views, **eight declare no named `@type` at all** —
  `MessagesJSON` among them, which is where #2037's fields live. The
  codegen renders named types, so listing those modules buys exactly
  nothing. All twelve DO carry `@spec`s (29 of them).

  So the third component digests what the views **declare** — the
  `@spec`s of their EXPORTED functions, read from BEAM chunks, over a
  module set derived from the build output rather than typed by hand
  (`json_view_spec_text/0`). It is fail-CLOSED twice: a new view is
  covered the moment it compiles, and a discovery that finds nothing
  RAISES instead of contributing an empty string.

  Deliberately NOT routed through the codegen: it would drag twelve views'
  shapes into `wireTypes.ts` and `wireSchema.ts`, and the schema one is
  RUNTIME validation for cic. Widening a runtime validator is a client
  change; this is a gate change, and they do not belong in one commit.

  ⚠️ **Two limits, stated so they are not rediscovered as surprises.**
  A view whose BODY grows a key while its `@spec` stands still is still
  invisible here — Dialyzer is the leg that catches that one, and that is
  an ARGUMENT rather than something measured in this session. And a spec
  that references a remote type is digested as the reference TEXT, so a
  change INSIDE `Grappa.Scrollback.count_split()` moves nothing unless
  that type is in the digest's set by another route.

  The digest is taken over BOTH generated artefacts — `generate/0`
  (`wireTypes.ts`) and `generate_schema/0` (`wireSchema.ts`) — concatenated.
  Covering only the schema was the first design and it rested on an
  unmeasured claim; measured, NEITHER artefact carries typedoc prose (three
  header lines and section markers between them), so there was no
  false-positive argument for preferring one, and no evidence that the two
  can never move independently either. Digesting both removes the
  assumption: any change to what the codegen emits demands a bump, which
  under "bump it every time" is the intended behaviour rather than a cost.

  Reformatting a typespec — blank lines, a comment inside the map literal —
  leaves both byte-identical, so the gate does NOT false-positive on
  formatting. Measured, not reasoned: `wire_pin_test.exs` is the standing
  check, and the one-off experiment is in DESIGN_NOTES.

  Generated-NOW, never read from the committed artefact: a developer who
  edits a typespec and forgets to regenerate is caught here too, rather than
  only by the sibling drift gate.

  ## Changing what the digest COVERS

  Not a wire-shape change, and the gate cannot tell — it sees a moved digest
  and a still number, which is the violation. Hit while building this, when
  the digest was widened from one artefact to both: `--update` refused, and
  it was right to. The route is to DELETE the pin and re-create it, because
  a deleted tracked file is visible in review while a `--force` flag would
  be the hole the refusal exists to close. Do not add one.

  ## Cost, accepted knowingly

  The digest covers the WHOLE schema, so a shape change in an admin-only
  payload no client reads still demands a bump. Under "bump it every time"
  that is the correct behaviour and not a defect — but it is the recurring
  price, and it is named here rather than discovered.

  ## Offline by construction

  No git, no network, no subprocess. CI without a remote runs this
  identically; `wire_pin_test.exs` asserts that property on this file's own
  source rather than trusting this paragraph.

  ## Usage

      mix grappa.wire_pin --check     # the gate (scripts/check.sh, CI)
      mix grappa.wire_pin --update    # refresh the pin; refuses a bare digest bump

  There is no default mode on purpose. A bare invocation that silently
  rewrote the pin would be the one command that greens the gate by accident.
