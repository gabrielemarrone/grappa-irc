defmodule Grappa.Session.CtcpReplyEffectTest do
  @moduledoc """
  Issue 1988 — the `:reply` effect JUNCTION between `Session.EventRouter`
  (the producer) and `Session.Server.apply_effects/2` (the consumer).

  `apply_effects/2` has exactly one `:reply` clause and it takes the
  3-tuple `{:reply, line, origin}` the effect grammar declares (#1390
  slice 6). Four producers still emitted the pre-#1390 2-tuple
  `{:reply, line}`, and there is no catch-all `apply_effects` clause — so
  each of them killed the session GenServer with `function_clause`. An
  inbound `/ctcp <victim> USERINFO` from any user on the network was
  enough, with no opt-in and no authentication on the victim's side.

  ## Why these tests drive the real session and not `EventRouter.route/2`

  `event_router_test.exs` already covered all four sites, and every one of
  those tests passed while production died three times in one evening.
  They assert the CONTENT of the tuple the producer returns, in isolation,
  so they type-check the producer against itself: the defect lives in the
  junction, where a shape the producer is free to emit meets a consumer
  that cannot match it. A test that can stay green while the session dies
  is a mirror, not a test.

  So each test here feeds a real line into a real `Session.Server` over a
  real TCP socket (`Grappa.IRCServer`, the in-process fake ircd — never a
  `:gen_tcp` mock) and then asserts the two things the isolation tests
  structurally cannot see:

    * the answer actually reached the wire, and
    * the session pid that was serving before the CTCP is the SAME pid,
      still alive, afterwards.

  The pid identity half matters as much as the liveness half: `Session.Server`
  is `:transient`, so a crash is followed by a supervisor restart under a
  NEW pid that re-registers the same key. `Process.alive?/1` on a
  re-looked-up pid would therefore go green a few milliseconds after the
  very crash it is meant to catch.

  `async: false` because `Grappa.SessionRegistry`, `Grappa.SessionSupervisor`
  and `Grappa.PubSub` are singletons — same reason as `server_test.exs`.
