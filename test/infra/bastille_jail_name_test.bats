#
# The bastille jail NAME is written once, and every live spelling agrees
# with it (#2022).
#
# The bug this exists to stop: `scripts/deploy-m42.sh` defaulted JAIL to
# `grappa`, and `infra/freebsd/deploy.sh` built its restart hint on the same
# name — the hint printed when the daemon is GONE. The jail is called
# `grappa-new`; `grappa` is its host.hostname. So the line an operator pastes
# to bring production back addressed a jail that does not exist.
#
# `infra/lib/bastille_jail.sh` is the one place the name is written for the
# consumers that COMPUTE with it. The ~30 remaining spellings are usage
# comments and runbook incantations, which cannot source a variable — this
# gate is what holds those to the same value, and what turns the next rename
# into a list instead of a repo-wide grep.
#
# Three properties, in the order that makes each one readable:
#
#   1. the CONSTANT exists and is non-empty (a gate that compares against an
#      empty expectation would pass on an empty tree AND on a broken source);
#   2. the DETECTOR bites — a stale spelling planted in a sandbox is found and
#      named, so a green run on the real tree means "nothing stale", not "the
#      regex died";
#   3. the REAL TREE agrees, with a floor on how many sites were examined.
#
# ── What the detector sees, and what it does not ────────────────────
# It matches a jail name in ARGUMENT position: after a bastille verb that
# takes a jail, after `jexec`, after `pkg -j`, and inside a
# /usr/local/bastille/jails/<name> path. A token spelled as a variable or a
# placeholder (`${JAIL}`, `"$JAIL"`, `<jail>`) is not a literal and never
# matches — those are the sites that already read the constant.
#
# It is line-based, so it cannot see a name that prose wrapped onto the next
# line, and it cannot see one named outside a command (`the jail is called X`).
# Both classes exist in docs/OPERATIONS.md and were fixed by hand in #2022;
# neither is claimed to be covered here.
#
# Chronological records are OUT of scope by design: docs/DESIGN_NOTES.md, its
# docs/design_notes/ archives, docs/project-story.md, docs/reviews/ and the
# dated baselines quote what was true when written. A log that gets rewritten
# to stay current is not a log.
